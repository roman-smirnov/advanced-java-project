# Development Workflow

# Minimum API Level

- Don't be scared - we can change everything later!
- Each new release happens ~1 per year and brings improvements and new features. 
- Min SDK - the minimum OS version on which the app will run.
- Apps are are forward compatible for many years, can also be easily updated. 
- OEMs usually ship phones with the latest available version and provide OTA updates and support for ~2 years.
- There are support libraries, inependent of API level, which bring new features to older Android versions.
- Devices not approved by Google don't get support and extension libraries.

# Activity

### Concept 

- It's a single "screen" in our app
- It's a window/gateway into the Android framework
- It's a stand-alone piece of the app

### Practice

- It's a Java class we inherit from
- For anything the user does - an activity method gets called
- For anything we want to do - we call it
